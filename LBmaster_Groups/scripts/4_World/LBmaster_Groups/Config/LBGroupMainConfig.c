/*This is the Main Config of the Advanced Groups Mod. You can tweak a lot of things here, but these are the most important settings you find in this file:

- Invite Action or Player List (`inviteActionEnabled`)

- Enable / Disable subgroups to divide bigger groups into smaller ones (`enableSubGroups`)

- Map Legend to have a small Legend on the Map explaining different icons to make the Map a bit more clean and better to read

- Compass, GPS (Minimap) and Player List (top left list with all players and their health) Settings

- Info Page settings for custom buttons and descriptions

- And more, just read through the settings if you find anything interesting
